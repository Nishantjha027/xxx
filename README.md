Cloud strategy for Sonic electronics limited.

Introduction:
In this report  I will review the present I.T setup of Sonic Electronics Limited and recommend an appropriate cloud strategy which can be helpful for  similar enterprises. The prime focus of my analysis will be cost ,resource allocation, Security and scalability considerations.

A short background about the company Sonics electronics limited , gathering more information about the current I.T setup and providing recommendations on future deployement.


Sonic Electronics Limited.
Sonic electronics limited is a manufacturing company established in Gujarat,India specialized in consumer electronics products. The company has been well established for decades with a steady growth in consumer electronics.The current I.T infrastructure is traditional on premises infrastructure with servers,networking equipment & storage house in their own data center. The lightining fast growth in consumer electronics with advancement in cellular technologies soar the demand which lead to modernize the digital infrastructure to tap the demand and registered growth.

Sonic electronics established in 2012 deals in speaker, headphones,buds, trimmers, displays,sensors,chargers, wireless charger and various types of cable wires in storage houses.

The company employs nearly 200 people in a manufacturing company in Gujarat and aims to commence their exports from 2025 to emerging markets to increase their presence globally.



The company marks their presence digitally with the help of e-commerce platforms, companyâ€™s website, registered distributors and a well established supply chain management system called Enterprise Resource Planning.

 Current I.T Setup and Recommendations.
 
Aim to provide rationale and justification based on cost,security,scalability and resource allocation. The report will focus on Customer relationship management, supply chain management, Ecommerce, Company website and Email marketing.

Software as a service (SAAS) is used as per requirement of the business and infrastructure required for further growth. 

On- premises servers:
The company operates a fleet of physical servers to host their critical applications such as Enterprise resource planning(ERP), Supply chain management(SCM) and customer relationship management (CRM).
Storage Infrastructure:
The company uses Network -Attached storage and Direct-attached storage for data storage needs

Backup and data Recovery:
Timely data backup processes are completed in Tapes and stored in specific locations.

Email servers:
Sonic electronic limited hosts the email servers on-premises.



Application and Website Hosting:
The company hosts services in their  dedicated in-house servers.


ON-PREMISE SERVERS VS.CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE

The company should move their in-house servers to cloud giants like salesforce.com, Azure and Amazon web services for scalability,cost effectiveness (pay as you go),scheduled updates, maintenance and security threats of data mitigation.This step will also help for full control over hardware which is suitable for legacy applications.

Recommendations:

Migrate from on premises servers to cloud based infrastructure to mitigate any threats and utilize the hardware with greater efficiency with firewall security patch by services providers. The gathering and generating a pattern based on A.I can pivot any products or services in a company with high degree of accuracy.

ON-PREMISE V/S CLOUD BASED STORAGE
 
ON -Premises storage:

This increases  control over data directly which would reduce the threat as low as     possible for security theft or breach, However the latency of data remains low.The on -premises storage increases the cost of maintenance , scalability and is prone to any physical disaster.


Cloud Storage solutions

The scalability of infrastructure is an important factor to consider with reference to growth. Accessibility of infrastructure and data would be available throughout the globe, however the data transfer cost may be higher and it also generates dependency.

Recommendations
The accessibility and scalability of data will help to grow more and reduce the dependency on many concerns like data theft, security breach, Infrastructure expansion and low latency. It also helps in data backup and recovery.The company can reduce high infrastructure and maintenance cost by migrating to cloud.

On backup Data recovery v/s cloud based data recovery.
The company currently has dedicated data centers for backup and recovery with encryption. It has to pay a high cost to store data which can be utilized for generating trends and patterns with reference  to recovery & backup.
If the company adopts the cloud model maintenance,scalability, backup and security will be processed automated. The ongoing high subscription cost can be a barrier for adoption.

Recommendations.

Cloud based backup and DR provided automated and cost effective solutions as well as reducing the risk of data loss & enabling faster recovery .The cloud scalability ensures that resources can grow as the data volume increases,whereas offsite storage enhances disaster resilience.e.g (Microsoft 365, google workplace, zoho etc.)



E-mail Servers.
The company currently stores data in premises for reducing the vulnerability of exposing it to the customer or any ransomware attack.

Recommendations
The company should migrate their servers to Microsoft 365 for better internal or external communications. It will help the I.T team to deal with other dedicated tasks. Cloud 365  offers privileges in the form of security, data leak and scalability with less maintenance cost. 

            Application & Website hostings.

The  company hosts their application & website hosting in their dedicated in-house     servers to store consumer data that might be affected with security theft or attack.
The online stores becomes increasingly burdened as 

Recommendations:
The company should Migrate their hostings on applications like shopify and dukaan for better consumer engagement and response.
The platforms provide services with growth levied on competitors with better insights and automation tools. The company needs to hire a dedicated team to build automation tools which would levy high cost comparison to returns. It can utilize the existing resources in the market.

Conclusion:
Observing the competition to grow and acquire the market, digital infrastructure plays a 
Vital role for companies to utilize the data and patterns for strategic decision and
Encouraging growth.Cloud infrastructure helps a company to manage their data 
Compared  to single owned infrastructure. We suggest sonic electronics limited to adopt 
the public cloud infrastructure rapidly. The benefits of smaller organization has agility 
and Flexibility for adoption of cloud services easily.
