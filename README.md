 True electronics limited.

Introduction:
The report will review the  digital infrastructure of true electronics limited and will suggest the modernisation with reference to future requirements. The main focus of review will be cost optimization, better  digital hardware allocation , safety and agility .

The company will be critically evaluated for future requirements , threats , modernization , automation and  fast upgradation to amalgamate with modern tools and enhance their presence in the targeted markets.

True  Electronics Limited.
True electronics limited is a production unit established in India ,specialized in consumer electronics hardware. The company was established for about a  decade with a steady growth in consumer electronics.A high investment planned was executed recently to meet the digital demand and to further prepared for expansions and upgradation to link  the forecasted growth

True  electronics established in 2012 produces speakers, headphones,buds, trimmers, displays,sensors,chargers, wireless chargers and various types of cable wires in production  houses.

They have a team of  nearly 100 people in a manufacturing company in Gujarat and aim to commence their exports from 2025 to emerging markets to increase their presence globally.



The company registered  their presence digitally with the help of re-selling platforms, website and digital marketing agencies.

 Current Digital Infrastructure .

True electronics is still less modernized with respect to available hardware and services . The unit  has developed I.T assets within premises. The cost of maintaining and replacing the fatigue is high due to specialized teams and skills are required to observe and maintain which shoots the cost , while  cost optimization can be reduced with cloud infrastructure and teams can focus on their responsibilities. The increasing price in electrification and reducing pollution can become someone else's problem, just by adopting any  trusted cloud partners solution.

Software as a service (SAAS)  model is selected  as per requirement of the business and infrastructure  expansion.. 

Servers inside the units

The company uses  physical servers to host their applications such as Enterprise resource planning(ERP), Supply chain management(SCM), Internal communications.

Digital Storage Infrastructure:
The company uses Network -Attached storage and Direct-attached storage for data storage needs

Backup and data Recovery:
Human need is required to commence the program for backup and data recovery. High chances of proliferation.

Email servers:
True electronic limited deployed physical  servers inside the units .



Application and Website Hosting:
The company hosts services in their  physical  in-house servers.

 COMPARING PHYSICAL SERVERS WITH CLOUD SOLUTIONS.

The company should adopt the services of cloud companies like salesforce and AWS, which will help in expansion as per requirement with effective measure.It will also help in utilization of new tools like automation, current technology, safety and protection , highly encrypted and trusted solutions.
Physical servers are vulnerable to many things such as higher low voltage can reduce the life , fatigue failure , Maintenance, Development team, Upgradation team , monitoring team. The safety and security of ransomware remains a challenge as the ransomware can affect the whole servers or might limit the recovery. 

SUGGESTIONS:
Migrate from on premises servers to cloud based infrastructure to mitigate any threats and utilize the hardware with greater efficiency with firewall security patch by services providers. The gathering and generating a pattern based on A.I can pivot any products or services in a company with high degree of accuracy.
Migrate with proper phase planning for the adoption of cloud to secure data and modernize the infrastructure . There are many tools and services which can enhance their perspective and presence across the world  digitally

COMPARE  PHYSICAL SERVER STORAGE WITH  CLOUD STORAGE SOLUTIONS.


 
PHYSICAL DATA STORAGE:
The data can be only accessed by the company as it has stored data inside its infrastructure. The data recovery and backup will consume more physical area that can be challenged with upgrading. To modernize the physical data servers consume high investment and are always prone to ransom attack or proliferation of data.The latency remains low and limited access throughout the globe according to the policies of company and government with regards to data.Highly prone to natural calamity.

Cloud Infrastructure.
The accessibility of data will be across the earth. Pay as you go model helps a company to utilize the cloud infrastructure as per the demand for proper allocation of resources. The safety and protection are highly monitored. The tools and advancements can be accessed easily .  A team of  engineers are available for any query or issues. The data are encrypted and compiled by the norms of the organization and governments.

Suggestion
The unit should be moved from physical servers and data centers to cloud based  solutions quickly as many of the tasks which are traditional like safety, upgradation , Maintenance, pollution generation , regulation compilation , backup , automation and advancements and precise insights of markets can be eliminated.

Compare physical backup recovery with  cloud recovery solutions.
The company currently has dedicated data centers for backup and recovery with encryption. It has to pay a high cost to store data which can be utilized for generating trends and patterns with reference  to recovery & backup. The ongoing high subscription cost can be a barrier for adoption.



Physical  data backup & Recovery.
   True electronics presently store data for backup in their non modernized servers which were used for many years and were removed from the system for the advanced hardwares. The backup data are highly vulnerable as the analysis conducted doubts on the hardware used to store are not as per standards. The maintenance cost is high.It is prone to attacks as it is a separate entity just for storing and balancing the loads if required for true electronics.

Cloud backup and recovery solutions
 The services offered by partnered cloud solutions are automated data and recovery algorithms with highly encryption . it can be accessed globally with permission . The latest infrastructure is deployed with highly skilled resources to tackle any downtime or potential threats . Trust and honest deployement are expected with data . It is suggested to adopt AWS and eliminate all the physical servers  recovery methods.
Not prone to any natural disaster as load data can be accessed with multiple data centers

Suggestions:
True electronics must migrate to trusted cloud solutions
Adaptable and cost effective
Less prone to natural or cyber attacks..

E-mail Servers.
At present,organizations maintain information on-site to lessen risk of exposure to ransomware attack or any breach.

Recommendations
Switch to Microsoft 365 to ensure  secure connectivity and cloud advancement.


            Application & Website hostings.

True electronics store data on servers which are in -premises to limit the data theft or lose control. The data of solutions are extremely precious to grow and generate insights about information.

Recommendations:
Sites like dukaan and shopify could be used for advertising and broaden the attraction of equipment with community.Reduce expenses on I.t employees as assigned tasks would be  completed by trusted companies

Conclusion:
The infrastructure plays an essential role for an organization to utilize the consumer electronic  decision for future growth. Cloud adoption plays a significant part compared to on premises infrastructure. The flexibility for forecasted growth can be tapped and agility can be utilized for forecasted growths.
